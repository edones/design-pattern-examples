# Factory Method Pattern

- Doesn't expose instantiation logic
- Flexible objects - multiple constructor
- Common interface/ contract driven
- Concrete instance/ classes
- Fresh instruction
- Parameterized create method
- Examples:
  - Calendar
  - NumberFormat
  
- Be careful of complexity
- Refactor
